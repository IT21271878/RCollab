## ðŸš€ About The Repository
Our group of friends recently created a new repository on Github with the aim of using Rstudio to improve our understanding of Probability and Statistics for our college module. We believe that using Github and Rstudio will enable us to collaborate more effectively and share our knowledge and findings with each other. Our hope is to use this platform to generate valuable content and resources that will not only benefit our group but also anyone else who is interested in learning about Probability and Statistics. We are excited about this opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to the open-source community. Stay tuned for updates on our progress!

## ðŸ¥… Goal

The goal of our GitHub repository is to collaboratively learn and apply RStudio for Probability and Statistics, with the aim of improving our analytical skills and enhancing our academic performance.
